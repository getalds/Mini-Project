# Mini-Project
Cardiovascular (CVD) Disease Prediction

This project is about determining which numeric variabele is the most important in determining CVD, and calculating if the individual has a high risk of getting CVD.

Exploratory Analysis: Showing the variables of the dataset, visualizing them

Data Cleaning: checking if there are any null or missing values in dataset, found discrepencies and cleaned them up

Problem 1: Determining which numeric variable is most important in determining CVD for Males.

Problem 2: Given the variables, predict if an invidual has a high risk of having CVD.

Takeaways: Using different types of classifiers and using new visualization methods.
